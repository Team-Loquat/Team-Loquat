    * Systemjs - module loader
    * Navigo - routing
    * MDB(Material design for bootstrap) - UI colors and UI components
    * Toastr - notifications
    * Handlebars - template engine

# 3. Other tools
    * eslint google-config - consistent code style
    * live-server - fast preview
    * google chrome dev tools - debugging

    * Better queries for more accurate results (more parameters)
    * More responsive and stylish user interface
    * Extract complex functions, into more simple and reusable small functions
