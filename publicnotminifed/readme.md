# 1. Idea
Collections application, where you can save your favorite movies, books and songs. The idea is to be simple and easy for the users to find what they want with one click and share it with friends.

# 2. Libraries we used
    * jQuery - mainly for ajax requests and dom manipulations
    * Systemjs - module loader
    * Navigo - routing
    * MDB(Material design for bootstrap) - UI colors and UI components
    * Toastr - notifications
    * Handlebars - template engine

# 3. Other tools
    * eslint google-config - consistent code style
    * live-server - fast preview
    * google chrome dev tools - debugging
    * firebase-tools - deploying in cloud

# 4. Firebase
    * Firebase hosting
    * Firebase authentication

# 6. Things we wanted to improve, but we didn't have time
    * Added items to show directly in collection without refresh
    * Better queries for more accurate results (more parameters)
    * More responsive and stylish user interface
    * Extract complex functions, into more simple and reusable small functions
    * Use hash table to hide collection and item id's 
    * Set up authentication settings for database instead of public
